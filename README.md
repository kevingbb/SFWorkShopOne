# SFWorkshopOne
This is the first Service Fabric workshop in a series of 3. This workshop is focused around buildling a simple stateless service that exposes a Math like API for doubling a number that is passed in.

If no number is passed in it will return a message stating no number found. If a number is passed in it will return the number times itself (doubled).

API Examples:

api/doubles       Returns "No Number Provided."

api/doubles/5     Returns "25"
